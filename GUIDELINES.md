**Contributing to Short Fuse Games**

We appreciate your interest in contributing to Short Fuse Games! Whether you're here to fix bugs, improve documentation, or add new features, your contributions help us make our games better. Below is a guide on how to get involved and contribute effectively.

**How to Contribute**

1.  **Fork the Repository**\
    To begin contributing, the first step is to fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This ensures that you can work on your changes without affecting the main project until you're ready.

2.  **Create a New Branch**\
    Once you have forked the repository, create a new branch for the changes you're making. We encourage you to name your branch descriptively based on the task you're working on. For example:

    -   `feature/add-new-character`

    -   `bugfix/fix-ui-bug`

    -   `docs/update-readme`

3.  **Make Your Changes**\
    After setting up your branch, you can start making the necessary changes. For code changes, ensure that you're adhering to the existing coding style and best practices. If you're working on documentation, be sure to verify the information is accurate and clearly written.

4.  **Test Your Changes**\
    Before submitting your pull request, thoroughly test your changes. If possible, include unit tests to ensure everything works as expected. This helps maintain the integrity of the project.

5.  **Commit Your Changes**\
    Once you're happy with the changes, commit them to your branch with a clear and concise commit message. A good commit message should briefly describe the change and follow a simple structure:

    -   `[Type] Short description of the change`

    The types of commits are:

    -   `feat`: A new feature

    -   `fix`: A bug fix

    -   `docs`: Documentation updates

    -   `style`: Code style changes

    -   `refactor`: Code refactor

    -   `test`: Adding or updating tests

    Example:

    -   `feat: add new character to game world`

6.  **Push and Submit a Pull Request**\
    After committing your changes, push them to your forked repository and create a pull request (PR) to submit your changes to the main repository. In the PR description, provide a detailed summary of the changes you've made, and if relevant, link any issues it addresses.

**Pull Request Guidelines**

-   **Clarity**: Provide a clear description of what the pull request does.

-   **Issue Reference**: If your PR addresses a specific issue, include a reference to it (e.g., "Fixes #123").

-   **Small PRs**: Keep pull requests focused on a single change. Smaller PRs are easier to review and merge.

-   **CI Checks**: Ensure that all continuous integration (CI) checks pass before submitting. If your changes introduce tests, make sure they pass as well.

**Code of Conduct**

We follow a Code of Conduct to maintain a respectful and welcoming community. We ask all contributors to treat each other with kindness and professionalism. You can find the full Code of Conduct in the repository ([CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file](https://github.com/Short-Fuse-Games/.github/blob/main/CONDUCT.MD)).

**Reporting Bugs**

If you discover a bug in one of our projects, here's how you can report it:

1.  Search through the existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported.

2.  If not, create a new issue with the following details:

    -   A description of the bug.

    -   Steps to reproduce it.

    -   What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened.

    -   Screenshots, logs, or any other supporting information that can help us investigate the issue.
